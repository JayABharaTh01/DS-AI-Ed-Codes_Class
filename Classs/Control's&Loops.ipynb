two different visual patterns: a right-angled triangle and an inverted right-angled triangle, both constructed with asterisks.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","- Combine different loop types

The program execution then moves to the first statement after the loop.\n","# - The `continue` statement **skips the rest of the current iteration** of the loop and moves to the next iteration. The loop's execution continues with the next item (for `for` loops) or by re-evaluating the condition (for `while` loops).\n","#\n","# ### Use Cases for `break`\n","#\n","# Use `break` when you need to exit a loop entirely based on a specific condition, regardless of whether the loop has completed iterating through all its elements or met its original termination condition. Common use cases include:\n","#\n","# - **Finding a specific item:** Stop searching once the desired item is found.\n","# - **Encountering an error or invalid condition:** Exit the loop if something goes wrong or an unexpected value is encountered.\n","# - **Implementing search algorithms:** Terminate the search when the target element is located.\n","#\n","# ### Use Cases for `continue`\n","#\n","# Use `continue` when you want to skip processing for a particular iteration based on a condition but continue with the rest of the loop's iterations. Common use cases include:\n","#\n","# - **Skipping invalid data or inputs:** Process only valid entries and skip the rest.\n","# - **Filtering elements:** Perform operations only on elements that meet certain criteria, skipping those that don't.\n","# - **Optimizing loop performance:** Avoid executing unnecessary code within an iteration.\n","#\n","# ### Summary\n","#\n","# In essence, `break` is for **stopping** the loop, while `continue` is for **skipping** the current iteration and moving to the next. Choose `break` when the task is done or impossible to continue within the loop. Choose `continue` when you need to skip a specific case but want to keep processing other cases in the loop."],"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d57253e1"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","*   The `break` statement is
